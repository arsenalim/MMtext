                            People tend not to think about the consequences. They usually think they know what is
                            going to happen and how to deal with it, so there is no need to worry about it. But it is
                            <b>really hard to predict the future accurately</b>. Sometimes consequences can be
                            <b>hidden</b> and <b>long-lasting</b>. It can affect your life years after you've forgotten
                            what caused it. That's why people should try to
                            <b>limit their own freedom of expression</b>, especially on the internet, in order to be
                            safe and avoid <b>serious consequences</b>.

                            Freedom of digital expression is the <b>ability to post anything on the internet</b>. It
                            can <b>guarantee</b> that you are free to share your opinions and post any information you
                            want. But your freedom of digital expression can be limited because <b>other people can
                            track what you do</b> and <b>some hackers can steal your online persona</b>. Anything you
                            have said in the past can affect what you can say in the future and how other users will
                            react to your posts. In some situations, your freedom of expression can be
                            <b>restricted</b> or <b>removed</b>, and then it is no longer a freedom. It is important to
                            be careful about your posts, comments and anything else you leave on the internet to avoid
                            unpleasant consequences. As Internet users say:
                        </p>
                            <blockquote class="red-text">

                            So it is impossible to erase your digital footprint, and people should take care of what
                            their digital footprint looks like, because <b>it stays forever</b>.

                            You may have posted something provocative in the past, and it can determine how
                            <b>people feel about you</b> in the present. <b>Cancellation culture</b> is a growing
                            phenomenon these days and you can be a victim of it. Many years ago the internet was free
                            and you could post anything you wanted and it would not be considered serious, just a joke.
                            But now it can be taken as your <b>real opinion</b> and you <b>can't justify it</b>. This
                            puts a lot of pressure on your online personality, restricting what you can say and
                            changing the way people view you. For example, <b>Elon Mask</b> gets banned every week
                            because he always posts something really <b>provocative</b> and <b>controversial</b>. Now
                            he has too many haters for a mortal. But he is too powerful and too rich to face any
                            serious consequences. But many people aren't. There are many other examples of actors and
                            singers who have been cancelled and <b>lost their jobs</b> and <b>all their contracts</b>.
                            So people who have been fired can't really be active influencers on the internet because
                            it's almost <b>impossible to restore their reputation</b>. After someone has found
                            something inappropriate in their digital footprint, the only thing these people will get is
                            <b>hate</b>. That's to say, all their opinions are now banned and they lose their ability
                            to speak freely on the internet.

                            According to the statistics, it is not only society and hackers that can restrict freedom
                            of expression on the internet, but also companies. Many platforms such as
                            <span class="red-text">Facebook</span> or <span class="red-text">Google</span> don't want
                            to see unpleasant content hosted on their site, so they have to regulate content, thereby
                            limiting freedom of expression. It is not about your digital footprint and what you have
                            done in the past, but sometimes you can be banned by a service, not a user or hacker. For
                            example, if you have broken <span class="red-text">YouTube's</span> rules several times,
                            you may lose the ability to post videos there.

                            On the other hand, you may not be a <b>worthwhile target to be leaked or hacked</b>, maybe
                            no one on the internet is interested in your digital footprint. It is really
                            <b>difficult</b> and <b>wasteful</b> to hack and steal some information on the internet,
                            the process of hacking is really <b>hard</b> and <b>complicated</b>, so the information to
                            be leaked should be <b>worthwhile</b>. It can be some personal information or provocative
                            posts of some celebrities, and if you are not a popular person, you can not worry about it.
                            But <b>your money</b> is what you should be worried about. If you have large sums of money
                            in your bank account, it is likely that you will be hacked by someone who wants to <b>steal
                            your money</b>. Most people on the internet are not really rich and famous people. The
                            truth is, you are probably not an interesting victim of leakage, so you can do whatever you
                            want with your digital footprint. According to stationx.net, <b>1.5 billion</b> Facebook
                            accounts were stolen in 2021. That is almost half of all accounts. That means someone in
                            your family or circle of friends has probably been hacked. But you don't know such
                            examples, do you? That's because you're not a worthwhile target for hackers. This means
                            that if you are an <b>average internet user</b>, you should <b>not worry</b> about your
                            digital footprint. The chance of leaked data somehow affecting the freedom of digital
                            expression of the average user is really small.

                            created an artificial intelligence called "Conrad" that can not only detect your digital
                            footprint, but also predict the negative effects of your publication. It would be really
                            useful in the real world, but it is impossible. After all the travels in the episode, Lisa
                            decided to shut down the programme.
