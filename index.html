                            is really hard to accurately predict the future. Sometimes consequences can be hidden and

                            Freedom of digital expression is an ability to post anything in the internet. It can

                            your posts. In some situations your freedom of expression can be limited or eliminated at
                            all, and after that, it stops being a freedom. It is important to pay attention on your
                            post, comments and everything you leave in the internet space to avoid unpleasant

                            Digital footprint can lead to personal information which can be stolen by hackers or
                            companies. Your digital footprint is not only what you post, it could be some metadata
                            which different sites can collect by themselves without asking your permission. Such data
                            as ip adress, your location, passwords, emails, even the model of your computer can easily
                            be stolen. There are many examples of personal data being leaked in big sites and companies
                            such as Facebook or Amazon. Because of that there is big data base with personal information
                            of millions people in dark web. When your data is leaked it is easier to manipulate you.
                            Using your personal information found online hackers can threat by posting your personal
                            information on different sources where you wouldn't want it to be, steal your online money,
                            chat with your friends using your account and steal your online personality to do illegal
                            stuff on your behalf. It is limitation of your digital freedom because now you will do what
                            they want but not you because now some hackers can easily destroy your life. It is not only
                            digital limitation but physical. It can affect you in real world.

                            You could post something provocative in the past and it can determine people attitude to
                            you in the present. Cancellation culture is developing phenomena nowadays and you can be a
                            victim of it. Many years ago the internet was free and you could post everything you want
                            and it would be considered not serious, just as a joke. But today it can be considered as
                            your real opinion and you won’t be able to justify yourself. That brings a lot of pressure
                            on your online personality, limits what you can say and changes users’ attitude to you. For
                            example, Elon Mask is being canceled every week because he always post something really
                            provocative and debate. Now he has too many haters for a mortal. But he is to powerful and
                            to rich to fill any serious consequences. But many people aren’t. There are many other
                            examples of actors and singers who was cancelled and they lost their jobs and all their
                            contracts. So, cancelled persons can’t really be active influencers in the internet because
                            it’s nearly to impossible to restore the reputation. After somebody found something
                            inappropriate in their digital footprint, such people will meet only the hate. That’s mean
                            now all their opinions are banned and they lose their ability to speak freely in the
                            internet.

                            past, but sometimes you can be banned by a service not a user or hacker. For example, if

                            On the other side, you can be not a worthwhile goal for being leaked or hacked, perhaps no
                            one on the internet is interested in your digital footprint. It is really difficult and
                            wasteful to hack and steal some information in the internet, process of hacking is really
                            hard and complicated, so the information being leaked should be worthwhile. It can be some
                            personal information or provocative posts of some celebrities, and if you are not popular
                            person you can not worry about it. But your money is what you should worry about. If you
                            have huge amounts on your bank account, you will probably being hacked by someone who wants
                            to steal your money. The most users in the internet are not really rich and famous people.
                            The truth is you most likely are not interesting victim of leaking, so you can do whatever
                            you want with your digital footprint. According to stationx.net there were 1,5 billion
                            Facebook accounts had been stolen in 2021. It is nearly the half of all of the accounts.
                            That’s mean somebody from your family or friends definitely has been hacked. But you don’t
                            know such examples, right? That’s because it is not worthwhile target for hackers. This
                            mean, if you are average user of the internet you should not worry about their digital
                            footprint. It is really small chance that leaked data will somehow affect regular user’s
                            freedom of digital expression.
